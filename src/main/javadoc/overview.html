		Common interfaces and classes for Scriptorium libraries.
		
		<p>
		Scriptorium-family libraries provide fluent APIs for as-you-go output of structured
		text formats (e.g., JSON, XML, YAML, HTML). The goal of this Core library is to
		provide a solid foundation for developing format-specific libraries, and to allow
		interoperation between these libraries for polyglot output.
