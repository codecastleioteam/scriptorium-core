# Scriptorium Core
Common interfaces and classes for Scriptorium libraries.

Scriptorium-family libraries provide fluent APIs for as-you-go output of structured
text formats (e.g., JSON, XML, YAML, HTML). The goal of this Core library is to
provide a solid foundation for developing format-specific libraries, and to allow
interoperation between these libraries for polyglot output.
